<h2>CIS705 Assignment 3</h2>

<em>13 points; due Wednesday, October 1</em> 
<p>


<p>
You will extend the interpreter you built in
Assigment 2.
The extensions go in three parts. 

<h3>Part C: add objects</h3>

<p>
First, you add
object declarations and objects.  The objects are "structs" that hold var and proc
declarations, like we saw in Chapter 6 of the Lecture Notes.
A sample program will look and work like this:
<pre>
python run.py
Type program; OK to do it on multiple lines; terminate with  !
  as the first symbol on a line by itself:

int a = 1;
ob counter = new {int val = a;
                  proc inc(x) : val = ((val + x) + a);  print val; end;
                 };
proc p(): a = (a + counter.val)  end;
ob nothingyet = nil;

counter.inc(1);
p();
nothingyet = counter
!
</pre>
Here is the execution of the above program:
<pre>
Parse tree:
[[['int', 'a', '1'], ['ob', 'counter', ['new', ['struct', [['int', 'val', ['deref', 'a']], ['proc', 'inc', ['x'], [], [['=', 'val', ['+', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']], ['deref', 'a']]], ['print', ['deref', 'val']]]]]]]], ['proc', 'p', [], [], [['=', 'a', ['+', ['deref', 'a'], ['deref', ['dot', 'counter', 'val']]]]]], ['ob', 'nothingyet', 'nil']], [['call', ['dot', 'counter', 'inc'], ['1']], ['call', 'p', []], ['=', 'nothingyet', ['deref', 'counter']]]]
Execution:
3
activation stack = ['h0', 'h4']
heap = {
  h0 : {'a': 1, 'parentns': 'nil', 'counter': 'h1', 'nothingyet': 'nil', 'p': 'h3'}
  h1 : {'parentns': 'h0', 'val': 3, 'inc': 'h2'}
  h2 : {'body': [['=', 'val', ['+', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']], ['deref', 'a']]], ['print', ['deref', 'val']]], 'params': ['x'], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h1', 'locals': []}
  h3 : {'body': [['=', 'a', ['+', ['deref', 'a'], ['deref', ['dot', 'counter', 'val']]]]], 'params': [], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h0', 'locals': []}
  h4 : {'x': 1, 'parentns': 'h1'}
}
Successful termination.
activation stack = ['h0']
heap = {
  h0 : {'a': 4, 'parentns': 'nil', 'counter': 'h1', 'nothingyet': 'h1', 'p': 'h3'}
  h1 : {'parentns': 'h0', 'val': 3, 'inc': 'h2'}
  h2 : {'body': [['=', 'val', ['+', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']], ['deref', 'a']]], ['print', ['deref', 'val']]], 'params': ['x'], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h1', 'locals': []}
  h3 : {'body': [['=', 'a', ['+', ['deref', 'a'], ['deref', ['dot', 'counter', 'val']]]]], 'params': [], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h0', 'locals': []}
  h4 : {'x': 1, 'parentns': 'h1'}
  h5 : {'parentns': 'h0'}
}
</pre>


In the example, $h0$ is the handle to the global variables' namespace.  Variable
$counter$ is bound to the handle of a new namespace/object, $h1$, that holds $val$, $inc$, and $parentns$ (which is needed when evaluating the expressions that appear
in the object's $int$ declarations).

<p>
When 
$counter.inc(1)$ is called, it works just as you implemented it in Assignment 2: a new activation record, $h4$,
is constructed for the call to $inc$, and $h4$ is pushed onto the activation
stack.  (Note that $h4$ holds a $parentns$ link that is set to
$h1$, which is $inc$'s "parent object".)

<p>
Once $inc$'s code finishes, the stack is popped.  Then $p()$ gets called, and its
activation, $h5$, is pushed then popped. 

<p>
You must implement
these new parts of the language:
<spre>
D ::=  ...  |  ob I = E  
E ::= ... |  new T  |  nil
T ::=  { DL }
L ::=  I  |  L . I
</spre>

Here is the complete syntax, with the new parts included:
<pre>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<spre>
P : Program
CL : CommandList
C : Command
DL : DeclarationList
D : Declaration
EL : ExpressionList
</spre>
</td>
<td>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</td>
<td>
<spre>
E : Expression
T : TypeTemplate
L : LefthandSide
IL : VariableList
I : Variable
N : Numeral
</spre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

P ::=  DL CL

DL ::=  D;*
D ::=  int I = E  |  ob I = E  |  proc I ( IL ) : CL end 

CL ::=  C;*
C ::=  L = E  |  if E : CL1 else CL2 end  |  print E  |  L ( EL )

EL ::=  E,*
E ::=  N  |  ( E1 OP E2 )  |  L  |  new T  |  nil
    where  OP ::=  +  |  -
T ::=  { DL }
L ::=  I  |  L . I

N ::=  string of digits
IL ::=  I,*
I ::=  strings of letters, not including keywords
</pre>
To be safe, please download the $a23lex.py$ and $a23pars.py$ files
from the assignment web page and use them to replace what you used for Assignment 2.  These two files were revised on Sept. 12.


<h4>Interpreter input format</h4>

<p>
The input to the interpreter is the list-based parse tree constructed by the parser.
The new constructions are:
<spre>
DTREE ::=   ... |  ["ob", ID, ETREE]
ETREE ::=  ...  |  "nil"  |  ["new",  TTREE]
TTREE ::=  ["struct", DLIST]
LTREE ::=  ID  |  ["dot", LTREE, ID]
</spre>
The syntax of all forms of parse trees goes like this:
<pre>
PTREE ::=  [DLIST, CLIST]
DLIST ::=  [ DTREE* ]
           where  DTREE*  means zero or more DTREEs
DTREE ::=  ["int", ID, ETREE]  |  ["proc", ID, IDLIST, CLIST, DLIST]  |  ["ob", ID, ETREE]

CLIST ::=  [ CTREE* ]
CTREE ::=  ["=", LTREE, ETREE]  |  ["if", ETREE, CLIST, CLIST]
        |  ["print", ETREE]  |  ["call", LTREE, ELIST]

ELIST ::=   [ ETREE* ]
ETREE ::=  NUM  |  [OP, ETREE, ETREE] |  ["deref", LTREE]  |  "nil"  |  ["new",  TTREE]
      where  OP ::=  "+"  | "-"
TTREE ::=  ["struct", DLIST]
LTREE ::=  ID  | ["dot", LTREE, ID]

NUM   ::=  a nonempty string of digits
IDLIST ::= [ ID+ ]
ID    ::=  a nonempty string of letters
</pre>


<h4>Interpreter operation</h4>

You start from the interpreter you built for Assignment 2.
(<em>If you didn't complete at least Assignment 2, Part A, you must finish it
before you start this one</em> --- please see the instructor as soon as
possible to make an appointment to fix your Assignment 2 submission.  
Sorry, but it's useless to do this assignment without learning how to do Assignment 2, Part A.)

<p>
You have these structures to implement:
$"nil"$,  $["new",  TTREE]$,
$["ob", ID, ETREE]$,
$["struct", DLIST]$, and
$["dot", LTREE, ID]$.

<ol>
<li>
Within $interpretETREE$, implement $"nil"$ to have itself as its value.
Implement $["new", T]$ to call $interpretTTREE(T)$, whose job is to allocate an object, fill it with $T$,
and return the object's handle.

<p>
You define
$def interpretTTREE(ttree)$.  It receives arguments of the form,
$["struct", DLIST]$.  The function does this: <em>(i)</em> allocates a new namespace
and <em>pushes the namespace's handle on the activation stack</em>;
<em>(ii)</em> evaluates $DLIST$;
<em>(iii)</em>pops the activation stack and returns the popped
handle as its answer.

<p>
<li>
Within $interpretDTREE$, implement $["ob", I, E]$,
which <em>(i)</em> computes the meaning of $E$, <em>(ii)</em> validates that $E$ is either
a handle to an object or is $nil$, and <em>(iii)</em> binds $I$ to the meaning
in the active namespace (provided that $I$ is not already declared there).

<p>
<li>
Within $interpretLTREE$, implement $["dot", L, I]$.
This means you compute the handle named by $L$, call it $h$,
and then check if the pair, $(h,I)$ is a valid L-value (that is, variable
$I$ is a field inside the object named by $h$).
<em>Big Hint:</em> read the code for the virtual machine in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1.

</ol>
As usual, enforce declaration checking --- the same name cannot
be declared twice in the same namespace and
no name can be referenced or assigned to if it is undeclared
(this includes fields within objects).
Also enforce type checking in commands and expressions:
<em>Only a handle (or $nil$) can be assigned to an object variable,
and only an int can be assigned to an int variable.</em>
(Hint: use Python's $instanceof$ or $type$ operator to check types. See the notes,
<a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~schmidt/505f11/pythonstrucs.html">Terse notes on lists and dictionaries</a> on the CIS505 web page.)
Only ints can be used in arithmetic;
only procs can be called; and only objects can be indexed with dot notation.


<p>
<em>Remember to document appropriately your modified interpreter.
</em>

<h4>Testing</h4>

The $Ex3$ folder contains a file of test cases that you should use for testing
Part C.
Use at least these tests to check your implemetation.
You should also devise 2-3 additional tests to see if the interpreter detects program
errors and prints appropriate messages.

<p>
Place all the test cases and their output in a file named $tests.txt$

<h3>Part D: add classes</h3>

<em>Don't start this part unless you have built and tested successfully
Part C.</em>

<p>
Now you extend the interpreter
with classes.
A sample program looks like this:
<pre>
python run.py
Type program; OK to do it on multiple lines; terminate with  !
  as the first symbol on a line by itself:

int a = 2;
class counter : {int val = 8; 
                 proc inc(x) : val = (val + x); end;
                };
ob c = new counter;
proc p(): a = (a + c.val)  end;
c.inc(1);
p();
!
</pre>
Here is the execution of the above program:
<pre>
Parse tree:
[[['int', 'a', '2'], ['class', 'counter', ['struct', [['int', 'val', '8'], ['proc', 'inc', ['x'], [], [['=', 'val', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']]]]]]]], ['ob', 'c', ['new', ['call', 'counter']]], ['proc', 'p', [], [], [['=', 'a', ['+', ['deref', 'a'], ['deref', ['dot', 'c', 'val']]]]]]], [['call',['dot', 'c', 'inc'], ['1']], ['call', 'p', []]]]
Execution:
Successful termination.
activation stack = ['h0']
heap = {
  h0 : {'a': 5, 'parentns': 'nil', 'c': 'h2', 'counter': 'h1', 'p': 'h4'}
  h1 : {'body': ['struct', [['int', 'val', ['deref', 'a']], ['proc', 'inc', ['x'], [], [['=', 'val', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']]]]]]], 'link': 'h0',
 'type': 'class'}
  h2 : {'parentns': 'h0', 'val': 3, 'inc': 'h3'}
  h3 : {'body': [['=', 'val', ['+', ['deref', 'val'], ['deref', 'x']]]], 'params': ['x'], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h2', 'locals': []}
  h4 : {'body': [['=', 'a', ['+', ['deref', 'a'], ['deref', ['dot', 'c', 'val']]]]], 'params': [], 'type': 'proc', 'link': 'h0', 'locals': []}
  h5 : {'x': 1, 'parentns': 'h2'}
  h6 : {'parentns': 'h0'}
}
</pre>

<p>
The syntax has 
these two additions:
<spre>
D ::=  ...  |  class I : T
T ::=  ...  |  L
</spre>
That is, we can declare a class and call it.
The parser already implements the new constructions.

<h4>Interpreter input format</h4>

<p>
You must implement in your interpreter,
<spre>
DTREE ::=  ...  |  ["class", ID, TTREE]
TTREE ::=  ...  |  ["call", LTREE]
</spre>


<h4>Interpreter operation</h4>

<p>
There are two steps:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
Within $interpretDTREE$, implement $["class", I, T]$,
which behaves like procedure declaration, that is, $I$ is bound to
a closure containing $T$ and its link to global variables.
Please study the above example program.

<p>
<li>
Within $interpretTTREE$, implement $["call", L]$.
This works like procedure call, where $L$ is computed to a handle,
the closure labelled by the handle is extracted from the heap, and
provided that the closure holds a class, the
$TTREE$ within the closure is extracted and executed. 

</ol>

<h4>Testing</h4>

The $Ex3$ folder contains a file of test cases that you should use for Part D.
Use at least these tests to check your implemetation.
Place your tests and their outputs in your $tests.txt$ file.
You should also devise additional tests to see if the interpreter detects program
errors and prints appropriate messages.

<h3>Part E: add subclasses</h3>

Finally, we allow subclasses to extend super-classes.
A subclass can hold methods that <em>override</em>
methods in the superclass.
The syntax of declarations and templates become
<spre>
D ::=  ...  |  override I ( IL ) : DL CL end 
T ::=  extend T with { DL }  |  { DL }  |  L
</spre>
and the operator trees have two new constructions:
<spre>
DTREE ::=  ... |  ["override", ID, ILIST, DLIST, CLIST]
TTREE ::= ...  |  ["extend", TTREE, DLIST]
</spre>
Here is an example:
<pre>
class counter : { int val = 0; 
                  proc tick() : val = (val + 1); end;
                  proc set(t) : val = t;  // (*)
                  end;
};
class seconds : extend counter with {
                 int default = 60;
                 override tick() : 
                    if val : val = (val - 1);
                    else : set(default)
                 end;
};
ob c = new counter;
ob timer = new seconds;
c.tick();
print timer.val;
print timer.default;
timer.set(8);  timer.tick();
</pre>
Here is a diagram of the storage layout when the execution is doing
the call, $timer.set(8)$, at point $(*)$:
<spre>
<img src="ns.jpg">
</spre>
The picture shows these two important modifications:
<ul>
<li>
$timer$ names an object that holds the fields and methods of both classes
$counter$ and $seconds$, but 
<em>the override method, $tick$, ''erased"
the same-named method declared in the superclass.</em>
<li>
Closures no longer hold handles to nonlocal variables.
Instead, when a closure is called, the handle is calculated at the point of call:
<p>
For example, the call, $timer.set(8)$, calculates the L-value
coordinates, $(&epsilon;, 'set')$, fetches $&sigma;$
at those coordinates, and executes the closure code at handle $&sigma;$.
<em>$&epsilon;$ is used as the value of $parentns$</em> for the call
to $timer.set$.
</ul>


<p>
The layout looks a bit like Java's, and it
is simpler than the one in the Lecture Notes  --- no need for
a $super$-link, and $parentns$ is the same as the $this$-link.  (I am trying to be nice to you and give you less work to do.)

<p>
Here are the semantics of the new constructions:

<ol>
<li> The semantics of
$override I(...): CL end$ is to declare $I$ in the current, active namespace,
<em>provided that $I$ is already declared there</em>.
Otherwise, the interpreter signals an error (that there is no method to override).
<li>
The semantics of
$extends T with { DL }$ is to invoke the TypeTemplate, $T$, which constructs an object and returns its handle.  Next, the declarations
in $DL$ are added to the object just constructed.
<li>
In addition, you must alter the semantics of procedure call:
For $L(EL)$, do these steps
<em>(i)</em> Compute $interpretLTREE(L)$,
to get the L-value coordinates, $(han,name)$.
The value at $(han,name)$ is fetched from the heap ---
it should be the handle of a proc closure.
Extract from that closure $IL$ and $CL$.
<em>(ii)</em> evaluate $EL$ to a list of values 
<em>(iii)</em> Allocate a new namespace and push the new namespace's handle onto the activation stack. <em>(iv)</em> Within the new namespace, bind $parentns$ to $han$(!!!); bind the values from $EL$ to the corresponding names in $IL$. <em>(v)</em> Execute $CL$, and upon completion pop the activation stack. 

</ol>
An advantage of this implementation is that you do not add $this$ and $super$ links to objects --- you use $parentns$ as before.  Also, you need not recode
$interpretLTREE$.  Also, all the previous examples in Stages A-D work the same as before.   (What you <em>lose</em> with this simplified
implementation is the ability to distinguish between
fields and methods in the superclass from those in the subclass.
This becomes a problem when you extend classes that other people
wrote --- your code can "mess" with their fields and "erase" their methods.  The very last required test case exposes this flaw.)


<h4>Testing</h4>

The $Ex3$ folder contains a file of test cases that you should use for Part E.
Use at least these tests to check your implemetation.
Place your tests and their outputs in your $tests.txt$ file.


<h4>Teamwork possible this time only</h4>
I will give you the option of working with a partner on this assignment only.
If you wish to have a partner for this exercise,
please notify the instructor in person or by email by Weds., September 25, 5pm.

<h4>Submission and grading</h4>

Place your versions of $heapmodule.py$, $interpret.py$, and $tests.txt$ 
in the $Ex3$ folder.  (Don't alter and don't submit the other files.)
Zip the folder into a $.zip$ file and submit the $.zip$ file to the CIS505 site on K-State Online.
<em>If you are working with a partner, both you and your partner each upload the
same zipped folder to K-State online.</em>

<p>
The teaching assistants will study your work and your tests and apply some
additional tests before scoring the submission.
